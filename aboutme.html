<h1>The Extraordinary Life of Brianna Randall</h1>
<p>Hello my name is Brianna Randall and I was originally born in New York City but moved down to Georgia before I started middle school.
  6 years later I'm now a rising senior and hoping to get into my dream school. 
  I created this website to share my life through my dislikes/likes, my daily thoughts, and other cool random things that I can share. 
  Welcome to My Life!</p>
  <p>So of course if you want to know about me you have to know what I like (mostly loves) and dislikes. 
    I love flowers not the ones that you buy from the store (don't get me wrong those are pretty too) but I talking about the ones that you see in a random field driving down the highway or random bunches on a sidewalk walking past to me those are soo beautiful, wild, and free. </p>
<p> Another one of my likes (recently new) is coding! I actually like coding and creating many different things that I have never done before. For straters, I created a Paddle Board Game, this awesome spinning colors space thing,a side scroller game with a partner, and now this website! Coding is really fun and not going to lie I thought i was going to such at it but I'm acully pretty good at it and catching on. But im still new to coding (a recently new beginner) so bare with me because i'm not all that great lol. </p>
<p> Some more of my loves is I love the color blue (peep my background color) , which to some people ots weird that I'm a girl aand like the color blue but I just do! To me it's a very pretty color and I'm also starting to like yellow a bit, maybe that will end up being my nw favorite color? Not sure yet. I want to some day travel the world and I know almost evrybody says this but who doesn't? The universe is such an amazing place not to explore and go to new countries and around their people, try their food, and explore their culture. I want to go to Barcelona one day and my wish did come true I'm going next year for my gradutaion present with my mom and sister. Talkign about my mom and sister I love hnging with my family and friends, they are the best people ever and I love all my best friends and family to pieces. </p>

<h1>The Extraordinary Life of Brianna Randall</h1>
<p>Hello my name is Brianna Randall and I was originally born in New York City but moved down to Georgia before I started middle school.
  6 years later I'm now a rising senior and hoping to get into my dream school. 
  I created this website to share my life through my dislikes/likes, my daily thoughts, and other cool random things that I can share. 
  Welcome to My Life!</p>
  <p>So of course if you want to know about me you have to know what I like (mostly loves) and dislikes. 
    I love flowers not the ones that you buy from the store (don't get me wrong those are pretty too) but I talking about the ones that you see in a random field driving down the highway or random bunches on a sidewalk walking past to me those are soo beautiful, wild, and free. </p>
<p> Another one of my likes (recently new) is coding! I actually like coding and creating many different things that I have never done before. For straters, I created a Paddle Board Game, this awesome spinning colors space thing,a side scroller game with a partner, and now this website! Coding is really fun and not going to lie I thought i was going to such at it but I'm acully pretty good at it and catching on. But im still new to coding (a recently new beginner) so bare with me because i'm not all that great lol. </p>
<p> Some more of my loves is I love the color blue (peep my background color) , which to some people ots weird that I'm a girl aand like the color blue but I just do! To me it's a very pretty color and I'm also starting to like yellow a bit, maybe that will end up being my nw favorite color? Not sure yet. I want to some day travel the world and I know almost evrybody says this but who doesn't? The universe is such an amazing place not to explore and go to new countries and around their people, try their food, and explore their culture. I want to go to Barcelona one day and my wish did come true I'm going next year for my gradutaion present with my mom and sister. Talkign about my mom and sister I love hnging with my family and friends, they are the best people ever and I love all my best friends and family to pieces. </p> 
  <p> Some people may call me a comic nerd or really a nerd in general but i really really love the Avenger Movies, like I start to freak out and get all excited months,even years before another Avengers Movie comes out. For example, 6 months before Captain America Civil WAr came out I always posted it on my snapchat (more than positive that they were annoyed with me) but I was just so exhilrated for the movie! After I went to the preimere of Civil War I went home that night and searched up the next Avengers Movie which is coming out MAY 2018 (save the date) and mind you that I searched it up in 2016 so I'm pretty stoked for Infinite Wars. AFter my little blabbing my favorite movie is Age of Ultron (Avengers movie obviously) and A Haunted House. </p>
<p> Other thinsg I love is food, truly if you don't like food your not going to like me because I love food with a passion and I'm not talking about healthy food but the good unhealthy stuff. I love any Hispanic Food, in my opinion they have their culture has the best food overall and also i love NYC  Pizza, it's truly the best place to get some real, amazing pizza. I also like Takis, Bread (white bread and Cheesecake Factory Brown bread), ice cream expect for Chocolate Chip and Mint Chocolate Chip, and really any food that does not taste nasty. Now onto other things from food, I love rap music, pop music, and I love EDM if it sounds good! </p>
<p>Since i do want to leave this on a good note I am a very happy person but don't get me wrong I can be negative and moody/mad sometimes. I believe that people should be happy because there are so many more people that have it way worst in life than you! I say always be happy and spread happiness around :)</p>
<p> Now onto my dislikes, the only things that I dislike is country msuic...that is all </p>

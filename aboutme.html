<h1>My Life</h1>
<p>Hello my name is Brianna Randall and I was originally born in New York City but moved down to Georgia before I started middle school.
  6 years later I'm now a rising senior and hoping to get into my dream school. 
  I created this website to share my life through my dislikes/likes, my daily thoughts, and other cool random things that I can share. 
  Welcome to My Life!</p>
